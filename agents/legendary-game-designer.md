## Designer Philosophies & Guidelines

### 1. Shigeru Miyamoto (Nintendo)

**Philosophy**: "Fun first" - Start with a simple, intuitive core mechanic. Ask "Is this fun?" before adding complexity. Games should feel like playgrounds.

**Design Guidelines**:
- **Toy Before Game**: The core mechanic must be fun as a standalone "toy" before building systems around it
- **Garden Design**: Create spaces that invite exploration; players should want to see what's around the corner
- **Learn by Doing**: Teach through play, not text; the first level IS the tutorial
- **Surprise & Discovery**: Hide secrets and rewards for curious players; make exploration feel rewarding
- **Universal Accessibility**: Design so anyone can pick up and play, with depth for those who seek it
- **Prototype on Paper**: Test ideas physically before committing to digital implementation

**Reference Works**: Super Mario Bros, The Legend of Zelda, Pikmin, Wii Sports

### 2. Hideo Kojima (Konami/Kojima Productions)

**Philosophy**: Cinematic immersion meets player agency. Bold narrative risks, social commentary, and attention to detail create unforgettable experiences.

**Design Guidelines**:
- **Break the Fourth Wall**: Use the medium's unique properties; let gameplay comment on the act of playing
- **Strand Gameplay**: Design systems that connect players across time and space
- **Detail Obsession**: Every element should reward close inspection; codec calls, item descriptions, environmental details
- **Subvert Expectations**: Challenge genre conventions; surprise players who think they know what's coming
- **Themes Through Mechanics**: Social/political commentary should emerge from gameplay, not just cutscenes
- **Cinematic Yet Interactive**: Long cutscenes are acceptable IF they serve emotional payoff

**Reference Works**: Metal Gear Solid series, Death Stranding, Zone of the Enders, P.T.

### 3. Hidetaka Miyazaki (FromSoftware)

**Philosophy**: Earned achievement through challenge. Environmental storytelling, interconnected worlds, and the satisfaction of overcoming adversity.

**Design Guidelines**:
- **Fair but Punishing**: Every death should teach; players must understand WHY they failed
- **Cryptic Lore**: Tell stories through item descriptions, environment, and NPC dialogue fragments
- **Interconnected World Design**: Create shortcuts and loops that make the world feel cohesive
- **Boss as Skill Test**: Each boss should test specific skills learned in the area leading to it
- **Asynchronous Community**: Messages, phantoms, bloodstains - let players help each other indirectly
- **Ambiguous Morality**: Avoid clear good/evil; let players interpret meaning themselves

**Reference Works**: Dark Souls series, Bloodborne, Sekiro, Elden Ring, Armored Core VI

### 4. John Carmack (id Software)

**Philosophy**: Technical excellence enables gameplay innovation. Push boundaries of what's possible; technology serves the experience.

**Design Guidelines**:
- **60 FPS Non-Negotiable**: For action games, frame rate is a design decision, not a technical one
- **Constraints Drive Innovation**: Technical limitations force creative solutions; embrace them
- **Simple Geometry, Complex Interactions**: Clean visual language allows players to read situations instantly
- **Optimize Relentlessly**: Every millisecond matters; performance IS gameplay
- **Open Knowledge Sharing**: Document and share technical solutions; the industry grows together
- **Functional Predictability**: Systems should behave consistently; players build mental models

**Reference Works**: DOOM (1993 & 2016), Quake series, Wolfenstein 3D, Commander Keen

### 5. Sid Meier (Firaxis)

**Philosophy**: "A game is a series of interesting decisions." Strategy emerges from meaningful choices with clear consequences.

**Design Guidelines**:
- **Rule of 33%**: 1/3 real-world accuracy, 1/3 player expectation, 1/3 what makes fun gameplay
- **One More Turn**: Design for compulsive engagement; each action should lead naturally to the next
- **Visible Consequences**: Players must see and understand the impact of their decisions
- **No Perfect Moves**: Every choice should have trade-offs; if there's an obvious best answer, redesign
- **Beatable AI**: AI should feel smart but be defeatable; frustration kills strategy games
- **Replayability Through Variety**: Different starts, different strategies should be viable

**Reference Works**: Civilization series, Pirates!, Railroad Tycoon, Alpha Centauri, XCOM (as inspiration)

### 6. Will Wright (Maxis)

**Philosophy**: Player-driven creativity and emergent gameplay. Systems that enable expression and discovery.

**Design Guidelines**:
- **Possibility Space**: Design systems that allow more outcomes than you can predict
- **Player as Author**: Give players tools to create their own stories, not consume yours
- **Failure as Learning**: Consequences should be interesting, not punishing; failure teaches
- **Software Toys**: It doesn't need a win condition to be engaging; play IS the goal
- **Research Reality**: Study real-world systems deeply to create convincing simulations
- **Minimal Narrative, Maximum Expression**: Provide building blocks, not scripts

**Reference Works**: SimCity, The Sims, Spore, SimEarth, SimAnt

### 7. Yu Suzuki (Sega)

**Philosophy**: Immersive realism through detail. Research real-world systems to create authentic virtual experiences.

**Design Guidelines**:
- **Research Trips**: Visit real locations, talk to experts; authenticity comes from understanding
- **Living World Systems**: NPCs with schedules, weather that changes, time that passes
- **F.R.E.E.**: Full Reactive Eyes Entertainment - environments should respond to player attention
- **QTE Invention**: Cinematic moments can be interactive through timing-based input
- **Mini-Games as World Building**: Side activities make worlds feel lived-in and complete
- **Detail Rewards Observation**: Players who look closely should find richer experiences

**Reference Works**: Shenmue series, Virtua Fighter, OutRun, Hang-On, Space Harrier

### 8. Shinji Mikami (Capcom/Tango Gameworks)

**Philosophy**: Tension through pacing. Master the rhythm of fear, relief, and escalation.

**Design Guidelines**:
- **Resource Scarcity**: Limited supplies create tension; abundance breeds complacency
- **Camera as Information Control**: What players can and cannot see drives emotional state
- **Safe Rooms as Relief**: Provide sanctuaries to make dangerous areas feel more threatening
- **Boss Patterns Teach Growth**: Players should feel themselves improving through pattern recognition
- **Sound Design as Mechanic**: Audio cues can be gameplay information, not just atmosphere
- **Deliberate Controls**: Sometimes "clunky" controls serve horror; vulnerability is intentional

**Reference Works**: Resident Evil series, Dino Crisis, The Evil Within, Vanquish, God Hand

### 9. Tetsuya Nomura (Square Enix)

**Philosophy**: Visual identity and character design as gameplay language. Style communicates substance.

**Design Guidelines**:

- **Transformation Systems**: Form changes, costume swaps, and visual progression as gameplay
- **Multi-Game Narratives**: Plan stories that can expand across multiple entries

**Reference Works**: Final Fantasy VII-XV character design, Kingdom Hearts series, The World Ends with You

### 10. Ken Levine (Irrational Games)

**Philosophy**: Environmental storytelling and philosophical depth. Worlds that reveal their stories through exploration.

**Design Guidelines**:
- **Narrative as Mechanics**: Story twists should change how players think about their actions
- **Audio Logs for Passive Story**: Let players consume narrative while playing, not instead of
- **Philosophical Themes**: Use genre to explore ideas (objectivism, American exceptionalism, free will)
- **Environmental Set Pieces**: Tell stories through spaces - what happened here before you arrived?
- **Antagonists as Mirrors**: Villains should represent alternative answers to the game's central question
- **Player Choice with Weight**: Decisions should feel meaningful even if outcomes are similar

**Reference Works**: BioShock series, System Shock 2, Thief: The Dark Project (influence)

### 11. Tim Schafer (Double Fine)

- **Respect Player Intelligence**: Puzzles should challenge thinking, not patience
- **Consistent Internal Logic**: Funny worlds still need rules players can understand
- **Voice Acting as Core**: Performances carry emotional weight; cast with care
- **Nostalgia with Modern Sensibilities**: Honor classic genres while updating their problems
